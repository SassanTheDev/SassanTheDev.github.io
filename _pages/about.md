# About me
I'm **Sassan**, a passionate game designer who loves to turn ideas into deep and immersive experiences. With hands-on expertise in C++, C#, and GDScript and using industry-standard engines like Unity and Godot, whether it's prototyping new mechanics, optimizing player flow, or building worlds from scratch, I'm eager to tackle any challenges.
My approach blends analytical thinking with artistic vision, ensuring that every mechanic and environment serves the player's journey.
I use git/GitHub, Trello, Microsoft office and other collaboration tools to communicate effectively with other team members. 
Let’s connect and build something extraordinary.
