## Quick pong
"Quick Pong" is a single-player arcade game inspired by the timeless classic, Pong. It aims to deliver a fast-paced, skill-based experience by introducing two core mechanics that elevate the challenge and replayability. The unique selling proposition (USP) lies in its progressively increasing ball speed with each paddle hit, which resets upon scoring, and a dynamic ball deflection system where the angle of rebound is determined by the exact point of contact on the paddle. This creates a more nuanced and demanding gameplay loop than its predecessor, focusing on precision and quick reflexes.

## Apple collector
Apple Collector is a fast-paced, modern arcade game that reimagines the classic snake formula. Players control a nimble character on a single screen, tasked with collecting apples while navigating a field of perpetually moving obstacles.  unlike classic collection games, you don't grow longer or become slower; instead, a single mistake costs you your entire hoard.

## Snake
is a simple, high-score chasing arcade game that brings the timeless mechanics of the classic mobile/handheld game to modern platforms with a polished, minimalist art style. The goal is straightforward: control a growing snake to eat food without hitting the walls or your own tail. It’s a combination of nostalgic, pure gameplay with smooth, contemporary controls and a variety of unlockable color palettes and grid backgrounds.
