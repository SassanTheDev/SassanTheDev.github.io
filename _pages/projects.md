“Highborne: Legions of Lianshan” is a tactical roguelike deckbuilder that merges the strategic depth of a positional card game with the compelling run-based progression of a roguelike. You play as a commander who lead their army across a war-torn continent, conquering provinces, upgrading your deck, and battling increasingly powerful foes in pursuit of total domination. Each campaign is a high-stakes journey where every decision matters—from battlefield positioning and card synergy to map movement and resource management. This fusion of strategic layers creates a deeply strategic and replayable experience.

Mist Realm (Primary Title) is a 2D side-scrolling action RPG that blends tight, skill-based combat with deep environmental storytelling and a unique fantasy narrative. Players assume the role of Elara, the "Child of Alabaster," a white-haired outcast who must traverse a series of mystical realms connected by a primordial mist. The game's USP is its deeply integrated mist-based traversal and combat system, where the environment is both a puzzle and a weapon, and its narrative where each realm reflects an emotional state, directly influencing both the story and gameplay mechanics. As Elara masters the mist, she uncovers the truth of her destiny and challenges the technologically advanced Vulari Empire.
