“Highborne: Legions of Lianshan” is a tactical roguelike deckbuilder that merges the strategic depth of a positional card game with the compelling run-based progression of a roguelike. You play as a commander who lead their army across a war-torn continent, conquering provinces, upgrading your deck, and battling increasingly powerful foes in pursuit of total domination. Each campaign is a high-stakes journey where every decision matters—from battlefield positioning and card synergy to map movement and resource management. This fusion of strategic layers creates a deeply strategic and replayable experience.
